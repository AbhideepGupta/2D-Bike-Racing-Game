# 2D-Bike-Racing-Game
This project is a 2D Bike Racing Game developed in C++ using the WinAPI. The player controls a bike that moves vertically on a road to avoid incoming red car-like obstacles. The game features:

Game States: Menu, Playing, and Game Over.

Obstacle Management: Obstacles increase in number and speed as the score rises.

Score and Lives System: Players start with 3 lives and earn points by avoiding obstacles.

Collision Detection: When the bike hits an obstacle, the player loses a life. Game ends when lives reach zero.

Graphics: Custom-drawn bike, obstacles, lanes, and UI using GDI functions (e.g., Rectangle, Ellipse, TextOut).

Keyboard Controls: Arrow keys move the bike; '1' starts the game, '2' exits, and 'R' restarts after Game Over.

Overall, itâ€™s a simple yet dynamic game emphasizing real-time graphics, collision logic, and basic OOP design in a Windows environment.
